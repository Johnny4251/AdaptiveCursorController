# Adaptive Cursor Controller

**Project Overview**

In today's digital age, accessibility is crucial for ensuring everyone can benefit from technology. However, individuals with limited arm mobility often find traditional input devices like mice and keyboards challenging to use. The Adaptive Cursor Controller demo addresses this issue head-on by offering an innovative, hands-free solution. Utilizing cutting-edge computer vision technology, our project empowers users to control the mouse cursor through simple head movements, making digital accessibility a reality for those who need it most.

**Artificial Intelligence**

At the heart of our solution is the use of the pretrained keypointrcnn_resnet50_fpn model, a powerful tool in keypoint detection. This AI-driven approach accurately tracks head movements in real-time, translating them into smooth and intuitive mouse movements on the screen. By integrating pyautogui, we've ensured that these translated movements are seamlessly executed, providing a fluid and natural user experience. Whether it's browsing the web, navigating through applications, or engaging in creative work, our system is designed to enable complete digital access through head gestures alon
